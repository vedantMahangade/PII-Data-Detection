Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I'm reaching out to share an example of a job-related project I worked on in the past. During my tenure at XYZ Company, I was tasked with developing a user interface for a new software application. The goal of this project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that would make it easy for users to navigate the application and access its features. I began by conducting extensive user research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. This research helped me identify key design elements and features that would enhance the user experience. I then proceeded to create wireframes and prototypes of the interface, ensuring that it was visually appealing and consistent with the company's branding guidelines. I paid close attention to details such as button placement, font selection, and color schemes to create an interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Throughout the development process, I worked closely with a team of designers and developers to ensure that the interface met all technical requirements and was compatible with various devices and operating systems. I also conducted rigorous testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues that arose during the development phase. The successful completion of this project resulted in a user interface that was highly praised by both users and stakeholders. The application received positive feedback for its ease of use, intuitive design, and seamless navigation. If you're interested in discussing this project further, feel free to contact me via email at barbara.lee@yahoo.com or by phone at 032-5567-4656. You can also find me at 128 East Oak Street. In my free time, I enjoy playing handball, which helps me stay active and focused. I'm passionate about creating user-centric designs that enhance the overall user experience. I'm confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for your consideration.

It takes coordination and collaboration amongst multi-functional teams  such as weather watchers, logistics, deployment, dispatch, and field personnel to respond and attend to  its customers in time of need. Though the teams worked hard and gave their fullest, the customer  satisfaction score (CSAT) was negatively trending for the last 6 months. After interviewing several  members of the teams, it became apparent that while they knew what their specific challenges were and  even what possible solutions are, we needed to step back and develop cross-functional insights and  identify patterns on current reality first, i.e. What is?\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nBefore we can begin generating ideas and solutions to improve the operations and thus the CSAT, the  stakeholders needed to \\u2018map their minds\\u2019 and establish the design criteria together. We used the mind  mapping design thinking tool to accomplish this.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn preparation for the mind mapping exercise, we had previously created personas of team members in  each of the departments. We had also collected quantitative data around the operations such as volume  handled per day, peak and trough staff strength, technology adoption, and workflow.  In a large  conference room, posters with information gathered were affixed on the walls. Stakeholders from each  department participated in the exercise. Line managers and Senior Executives were also allowed to come  in and participate. Participants used index cards to write down their viewpoints on operational challenges  faced. We then helped the team identify 5 broad themes and created clusters of index cards around the  themes. Outliers were recorded and weren\\u2019t ignored.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nOne of the immediate outcomes of the exercise was both enlightenment and appreciation of work  performed by each department and how it collectively helps serving their customers. Second, challenges  as noted by one department took on whole new implications when considered in the larger scheme of  operations. As an example, the logistics team was planning deployments without up to date information\\n\\non current whereabouts of field personnel. We further had a lot of input from each department that led  of more accurate description of problem statements. Third, a number of tactical items were resolved  through better understanding of the current reality. These were quick-hit solutions and helped with the  momentum of the exercise.\\n\\nIn summary, I thought the mind mapping technique really engaged the stakeholders and made them  realize that inter-departmental solutions are needed to address their business problem as opposed to  isolated initiatives. It also helped us to focus on 5 main themes namely, operating model, technology  upgrade, process streamlining, customer experience and employee engagement/training which were  then used as a basis for brainstorming to generate ideas.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nI will continue to use the mind mapping technique to transition from the definition of problem(s) to  developing ideas to solve them. There was a strong but understandable inclination by the participants  towards solutioning the problem rather than establishing the design criteria. Through the experience  gained, I will be better able to conduct the exercise by impressing up on the need to establish \\u2018What is\\u2019  before moving on to \\u2018What if\\u2019. Also, I would employ the \\u2018So What\\u2019 question in the future more than I did  for the exercise above to help the stakeholders glean insights than mere observations.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Hi, my name is Carmen Chen and I work as an Industrial Engineer. I was faced with a unique challenge during my time at Smith and Jones Manufacturing. The company had been struggling with a significant amount of waste in their production process, leading to increased costs and environmental concerns. The main issue was that the machines on the assembly line were not properly synchronized, resulting in frequent stoppages and delays. This was compounded by the lack of communication between different departments, leading to further inefficiencies and rework. Additionally, there were several inefficiencies in the material handling and storage systems, causing delays and bottlenecks. To address these issues, I conducted a thorough analysis of the production process, identifying the root causes of the problems. I redesigned the assembly line layout, optimizing the flow of materials and products. I also implemented a new inventory management system that provided real-time updates on material availability and usage, reducing the chances of stockouts and overstocking. Furthermore, I developed a comprehensive training program to improve communication and coordination among different departments, fostering a culture of teamwork and collaboration. Through these changes, we were able to significantly reduce waste, improve productivity, and enhance the overall efficiency of the production process. As a result, Smith and Jones Manufacturing experienced substantial cost savings and increased profitability.

I.e a developer would ideate from a developer\\u2019s POV focusing\\n\\nmore on the technical aspects and a Business developer would do it from their POV\\n\\nfocusing on business goals etc.\\n\\nThe challenge here is to ensure that every team member involved in the project has a\\u00a0 common understanding of the project regardless of their involvement at any stage of\\n\\nthe project.\\n\\nThe solution to this challenge seems simple on the outside yet precarious when tackled.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe tool selected for this challenge is Mind mapping, due to its ability to visually\\u00a0 communicate large chunks of information in an organised manner. The tool would free\\n\\nup useful time which would otherwise be wasted explaining all the information to bring\\n\\npeople up to speed.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe approach was to create multiple mind maps at various stages which would\\u00a0 showcase the entire project journey and ensure any participant who would join midway\\n\\nin the project would catch up with the least amount of time wasted, this would also\\n\\nensure that each member is in sync with the final goal of the project as well while being\\n\\nable to see a broad view of the project to provide better ideas and spot potential issues.\\n\\nOnce a project was initiated, An empty room was selected and a \\u200bclient mind map\\u200b was\\u00a0 created which contained all of the client\\u2019s insights. This helped the design team process\\n\\nthe information faster and proceed with the next steps of ideation. Post the ideation\\n\\nsession another mind map (\\u200bideation mind map\\u200b) was created to showcase a refined\\n\\nproject idea which incorporated multiple missing facets that would otherwise impact\\n\\nthe success of the project. Post ideation was the research and design, we added in the\\n\\nresearch information into the \\u2018ideation mind map\\u2019 and the result of the design team was\\n\\na set of wireframes organised as app flows which were placed beside the ideation mind\\n\\nmap and showcased the resulting output of the project.\\n\\nAt this stage the client, a few developers, and business development team were\\u00a0 brought in to look at the work in progress.\\n\\nRather than explaining the complete process and work done by the design team, we\\u00a0 asked the client, developers and business development team to spend a few minutes\\n\\nlooking at the Client mind map, then the ideation mind map and then the app flow.\\n\\nThis brought all the stakeholders of the project in sync with the current status of the\\u00a0 project, the direction and saved everyone a lot of time. We proceeded doing this at the\\n\\nnext few stages of the design and development cycles to ensure the complete project\\n\\njourney is captured and each stakeholder is updated with the project status and\\n\\ndirection regardless of the time they joined the project.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nDuring the complete process of this experiment I noticed increased efficiency, better\\u00a0 idea generation and a unified hive style thinking approach that is seen when\\n\\nparticipants have spent close to 6-7 months working on the same project.\\n\\nWe were also able to generate ideas beyond our fields of expertise and also catch\\u00a0 issues that would have resulted in a lot of rework and significant loss for the client.\\n\\nWe had a few participants who had to keep shifting from project to project throughout\\u00a0 the process and they found it a lot easier to catch up with the progress and provide\\n\\nuseful insights during the time they spent.\\n\\nOverall, I was able to open my mind and think from various other perspectives, in a way\\u00a0 following this process helped us to get out of our metaphorical boxes, work together\\n\\ntowards a common goal and this helped us provide better quality to our clients.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNext time, I would probably involve a few additional people from specific fields when\\u00a0 constructing and app of a particular user base. Ex - if I were to create an alternative to\\n\\nfacebook AD manager, I would do my research, but also include multiple digital\\n\\nmarketers to the team and create a custom mind map of their thoughts on an ideal\\n\\napplication and also involve them in ideation sessions to help refine the alternative\\n\\napplication even more to suit its end users.\\n\\n----------Thanks for reading----------\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It takes coordination and collaboration amongst multi-functional teams  such as weather watchers, logistics, deployment, dispatch, and field personnel to respond and attend to  its customers in time of need. Though the teams worked hard and gave their fullest, the customer  satisfaction score (CSAT) was negatively trending for the last 6 months. After interviewing several  members of the teams, it became apparent that while they knew what their specific challenges were and  even what possible solutions are, we needed to step back and develop cross-functional insights and  identify patterns on current reality first, i.e. What is?\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nBefore we can begin generating ideas and solutions to improve the operations and thus the CSAT, the  stakeholders needed to \\u2018map their minds\\u2019 and establish the design criteria together. We used the mind  mapping design thinking tool to accomplish this.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn preparation for the mind mapping exercise, we had previously created personas of team members in  each of the departments. We had also collected quantitative data around the operations such as volume  handled per day, peak and trough staff strength, technology adoption, and workflow.  In a large  conference room, posters with information gathered were affixed on the walls. Stakeholders from each  department participated in the exercise. Line managers and Senior Executives were also allowed to come  in and participate. Participants used index cards to write down their viewpoints on operational challenges  faced. We then helped the team identify 5 broad themes and created clusters of index cards around the  themes. Outliers were recorded and weren\\u2019t ignored.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nOne of the immediate outcomes of the exercise was both enlightenment and appreciation of work  performed by each department and how it collectively helps serving their customers. Second, challenges  as noted by one department took on whole new implications when considered in the larger scheme of  operations. As an example, the logistics team was planning deployments without up to date information\\n\\non current whereabouts of field personnel. We further had a lot of input from each department that led  of more accurate description of problem statements. Third, a number of tactical items were resolved  through better understanding of the current reality. These were quick-hit solutions and helped with the  momentum of the exercise.\\n\\nIn summary, I thought the mind mapping technique really engaged the stakeholders and made them  realize that inter-departmental solutions are needed to address their business problem as opposed to  isolated initiatives. It also helped us to focus on 5 main themes namely, operating model, technology  upgrade, process streamlining, customer experience and employee engagement/training which were  then used as a basis for brainstorming to generate ideas.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nI will continue to use the mind mapping technique to transition from the definition of problem(s) to  developing ideas to solve them. There was a strong but understandable inclination by the participants  towards solutioning the problem rather than establishing the design criteria. Through the experience  gained, I will be better able to conduct the exercise by impressing up on the need to establish \\u2018What is\\u2019  before moving on to \\u2018What if\\u2019. Also, I would employ the \\u2018So What\\u2019 question in the future more than I did  for the exercise above to help the stakeholders glean insights than mere observations.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Hi, my name is Carmen Chen and I work as an Industrial Engineer. I was faced with a unique challenge during my time at Smith and Jones Manufacturing. The company had been struggling with a significant amount of waste in their production process, leading to increased costs and environmental concerns. The main issue was that the machines on the assembly line were not properly synchronized, resulting in frequent stoppages and delays. This was compounded by the lack of communication between different departments, leading to further inefficiencies and rework. Additionally, there were several inefficiencies in the material handling and storage systems, causing delays and bottlenecks. To address these issues, I conducted a thorough analysis of the production process, identifying the root causes of the problems. I redesigned the assembly line layout, optimizing the flow of materials and products. I also implemented a new inventory management system that provided real-time updates on material availability and usage, reducing the chances of stockouts and overstocking. Furthermore, I developed a comprehensive training program to improve communication and coordination among different departments, fostering a culture of teamwork and collaboration. Through these changes, we were able to significantly reduce waste, improve productivity, and enhance the overall efficiency of the production process. As a result, Smith and Jones Manufacturing experienced substantial cost savings and increased profitability.

I.e a developer would ideate from a developer\\u2019s POV focusing\\n\\nmore on the technical aspects and a Business developer would do it from their POV\\n\\nfocusing on business goals etc.\\n\\nThe challenge here is to ensure that every team member involved in the project has a\\u00a0 common understanding of the project regardless of their involvement at any stage of\\n\\nthe project.\\n\\nThe solution to this challenge seems simple on the outside yet precarious when tackled.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe tool selected for this challenge is Mind mapping, due to its ability to visually\\u00a0 communicate large chunks of information in an organised manner. The tool would free\\n\\nup useful time which would otherwise be wasted explaining all the information to bring\\n\\npeople up to speed.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe approach was to create multiple mind maps at various stages which would\\u00a0 showcase the entire project journey and ensure any participant who would join midway\\n\\nin the project would catch up with the least amount of time wasted, this would also\\n\\nensure that each member is in sync with the final goal of the project as well while being\\n\\nable to see a broad view of the project to provide better ideas and spot potential issues.\\n\\nOnce a project was initiated, An empty room was selected and a \\u200bclient mind map\\u200b was\\u00a0 created which contained all of the client\\u2019s insights. This helped the design team process\\n\\nthe information faster and proceed with the next steps of ideation. Post the ideation\\n\\nsession another mind map (\\u200bideation mind map\\u200b) was created to showcase a refined\\n\\nproject idea which incorporated multiple missing facets that would otherwise impact\\n\\nthe success of the project. Post ideation was the research and design, we added in the\\n\\nresearch information into the \\u2018ideation mind map\\u2019 and the result of the design team was\\n\\na set of wireframes organised as app flows which were placed beside the ideation mind\\n\\nmap and showcased the resulting output of the project.\\n\\nAt this stage the client, a few developers, and business development team were\\u00a0 brought in to look at the work in progress.\\n\\nRather than explaining the complete process and work done by the design team, we\\u00a0 asked the client, developers and business development team to spend a few minutes\\n\\nlooking at the Client mind map, then the ideation mind map and then the app flow.\\n\\nThis brought all the stakeholders of the project in sync with the current status of the\\u00a0 project, the direction and saved everyone a lot of time. We proceeded doing this at the\\n\\nnext few stages of the design and development cycles to ensure the complete project\\n\\njourney is captured and each stakeholder is updated with the project status and\\n\\ndirection regardless of the time they joined the project.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nDuring the complete process of this experiment I noticed increased efficiency, better\\u00a0 idea generation and a unified hive style thinking approach that is seen when\\n\\nparticipants have spent close to 6-7 months working on the same project.\\n\\nWe were also able to generate ideas beyond our fields of expertise and also catch\\u00a0 issues that would have resulted in a lot of rework and significant loss for the client.\\n\\nWe had a few participants who had to keep shifting from project to project throughout\\u00a0 the process and they found it a lot easier to catch up with the progress and provide\\n\\nuseful insights during the time they spent.\\n\\nOverall, I was able to open my mind and think from various other perspectives, in a way\\u00a0 following this process helped us to get out of our metaphorical boxes, work together\\n\\ntowards a common goal and this helped us provide better quality to our clients.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNext time, I would probably involve a few additional people from specific fields when\\u00a0 constructing and app of a particular user base. Ex - if I were to create an alternative to\\n\\nfacebook AD manager, I would do my research, but also include multiple digital\\n\\nmarketers to the team and create a custom mind map of their thoughts on an ideal\\n\\napplication and also involve them in ideation sessions to help refine the alternative\\n\\napplication even more to suit its end users.\\n\\n----------Thanks for reading----------\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mapped_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
